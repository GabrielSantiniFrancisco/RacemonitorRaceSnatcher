# 🏎️ RacemonitorRaceSnatcher

*"Pay for data? Nah fam, we boost the browser’s keys and slide into the WSS like it’s our own pit lane — just to drop clean race data on stream and make it look like we shelled out for the VIP package."*

## ⚡ What’s This?
RacemonitorRaceSnatcher is a scrappy little pit-crew script that:
- 🔑 **Boosts** the API key straight outta your browser (no shame).
- 📡 **Slides** into the RaceMonitor websocket feed like it owns the joint.
- 📺 **Pipes** that sweet, sweet live telemetry into your own broadcast stream.

In short: it’s the sketchy middleman that makes your stream look pro without burning a hole in your wallet.

If you run it on an actual event, don’t @ us when the pit wall lawyers start calling.
